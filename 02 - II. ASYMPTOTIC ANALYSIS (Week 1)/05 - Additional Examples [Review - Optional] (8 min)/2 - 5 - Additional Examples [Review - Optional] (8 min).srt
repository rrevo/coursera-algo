00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,283
This video is for those of you who want
some additional practice with asymptotic

2
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:08,672
notation. And we're gonna go through three
additional optional examples. Let's start

3
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:12,955
with the first one. So the point of this
first example is to show how to formally

4
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:16,921
prove that one function is big O of
another. So the function that I want to

5
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:21,733
work with is two raised to the N plus ten,
okay, so it's the two to the N function

6
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:26,740
that you're all familiar with, we're going
to shift it by ten and the claim is that

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,808
this function is big O of two to the N,
so without the ten. So how would one prove

8
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:36,273
such a claim? Well lets go back to the
definition of what it means for one

9
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:41,099
function to be big O over another, what we
have to prove is we need to show that

10
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:45,986
there exists two constants, so that for
all sufficiently large N meaning N bigger

11
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:51,487
than N-nought, our left hand side, so the
function should be N plus ten is bounded

12
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:57,120
above by a constant multiple C times the
function on right hand side to the N.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,537
Right so for all sufficiently large N the
function is bounded above by a constant

14
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:06,223
multiple of two to the N. So unlike the
first basic example where I just pulled the

15
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:10,748
two constants out of a hat let's actually
start the proof and see how you'd reverse

16
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:14,967
engineer the suitable choice of these two
constants. So, what a proof would

17
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,700
look like, it would start with two to the
N plus ten, on the left-hand side, and

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,527
then there'd be a chain of inequalities,
terminating in this, C times two to the N.

19
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:26,307
So, let's just go ahead and start such a
proof, and see what we might do. So, if we

20
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:30,134
start with two to the N plus ten on the
left-hand side, what would our first step

21
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:33,631
look like? Well, this 10's really
annoying, so it makes sense to separate it

22
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,613
out. So you could write two to the N plus
ten as the product of two terms. Two to

23
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:42,531
the ten, and then the two to the N. Also
known as just 1024 times two to the N. And

24
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:47,741
now we're in, looking in really good
shape. So if you look at where we are so

25
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:53,636
far, and where we want to get to, it seems
like we should be choosing our constant C

26
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:58,762
to be 1024. So if we choose C to be 1024
and we don't have to be clever with N-nought

27
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:03,560
we can just set that equal to one, then indeed
star holds to the desired inequality and

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,662
remember to prove that one function is big
O of another all you gotta do is come up

29
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:13,521
with one pair of constants that works and
we've just reverse engineered it just

30
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:18,623
choosing the constant C to be 1024 and N-nought
to be one works so this proves that

31
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:23,532
two to the N plus ten is big O over two
to the N. Next let's turn to another non

32
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:28,364
example how, of a function which is not
big O over another. And so this will look

33
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:33,076
superficially similar to the previous one.
Instead of taking, adding ten in the

34
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:37,908
exponent of the function two to the N, I'm
gonna multiply by ten in the exponent. And

35
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:42,619
the claim is if you multiply by ten in the
exponent then this is not the same

36
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:47,452
asymptotically as two to the N. So once
again, usually the way you prove one thing

37
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:51,502
is not big O of another is by
contridiction. So we're going to assume

38
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:55,901
the contrary, that two to the ten N is in
fact big O of two to the N. What would it

39
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:00,077
mean if that were true? Well, by the
definition of big O notation, that would

40
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:04,755
mean there are constant C and N-nought.
So that for all large N, two to the ten

41
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:09,074
N is bounded above by C times 2 to the
N. So to complete the proof what we have

42
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:13,025
to do is go from this assumption and
derive something which is obviously false

43
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:17,230
but that's easy to do just by cancelling
this 2 of the N terms from both sides.

44
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,137
So if we divide both sides by 2 to the
N, which is a positive number since N is

45
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:26,924
positive, what we find would be a logical
consequence of our assumption would be

46
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:31,938
that two raised to the nine N is bounded
above by some fixed constant C for all N

47
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:36,825
at least N-nought. But this inequality of
course is certainly false. The right hand

48
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:41,892
side is some fixed constant independent of
N. The left hand side is going to infinity

49
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:46,720
as N grows large. So there's no way this
inequality holds for arbitrarily large N.

50
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,818
So that concludes the proof by
contradiction. This means our assumption

51
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:55,493
was not the case, and indeed it is not the case
that two to the ten N is big O of two to

52
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:59,801
the N. So our third and final example is a
little bit more complicated than the first

53
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,813
two. It'll give us some practice using
theta notation. Recall that while big O is

54
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:07,875
analogous to saying one function is less
than or equal to another, theta notation

55
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:12,137
is in the spirit of saying one function is
equal asymptotically to another. So here's

56
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:16,049
gonna be the formal claim we're gonna
prove, for every pair of functions F and

57
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,111
G, both of these functions are defined on
the positive integers, the claim is that

58
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,621
it doesn't matter, up to a constant
factors, whether we take point wise

59
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,533
maximum of the two functions or whether we
take the point wise sum of the two

60
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:32,407
functions. So let me make sure it's clear
that you know I mean by the point wise

61
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:38,710
maximum by max F and G. So, if you look at
the two functions, both functions of N,

62
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:45,262
maybe we have F being this green function
here and we have g hooked to this red

63
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:49,704
function. Then by the point wise maximum
max(F,G) just means the upper

64
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:54,172
envelope of these two functions. So that's
gonna be this blue function. So lets now

65
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:58,694
turn to the proof of this claim that the
point wise function of these two function

66
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:03,307
is theta of the sum of two functions. So
let's recall what theta means formally.

67
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:08,070
What it means is that the function on the
left can be sandwiched between the

68
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,956
constant multiples of the function on the
right. So we need to exhibit both the

69
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:17,657
usual N-nought but also two constants, the
small one, C1, and the big one, C2, so

70
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:22,543
that the point wise maximum(F,G),
whatever that may be, is wedged in between

71
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:26,254
C1 and C2 times F(N) plus G(N),
respectively. So to see where these

72
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:30,645
constants C1 and C2 are going to come
from, let's observe the following

73
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:35,658
inequalities. So no matter what N is, any
positive integer N, we have the following.

74
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:40,671
Suppose we take the larger of F of N and G
of N. And remember now, we've fixed the

75
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:45,560
value of N, and it's just some integer,
you know, like 23. And now F of N and G of

76
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,511
N are theirselves, just numbers. You know,
maybe they're 57 and 74, or whatever. And

77
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:55,648
if you take the larger of F of N and G of
N, that's certainly no more than the sum

78
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:59,424
of F of N plus G of N. Now, I'm using, in
this inequality, that F and G are

79
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:03,190
positive. And that's something I've been
assuming throughout the course so far.

80
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,004
Here, I wanna be explicit about it, we're
assuming that F and G cannot output

81
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:10,722
negative numbers. Whatever integer you
feed in, you get out something positive.

82
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:14,005
Now, the functions we care about are
things like the running time of

83
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:17,626
algorithms, so there's really no reason
for us to pollute our thinking with

84
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:21,441
negative numbers. So, we're just gonna
always be assuming in this class, positive

85
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:25,158
numbers. And I'm actually using it here,
the right hand side is the sum of two

86
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:29,382
things, is bigger than just either one of
the constituent summants. Secondly. If we

87
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:34,598
double the larger of F of N and G of N
well that's going to exceed the sum of F of N

88
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,831
plus G of N, right? Because on the right
hand side we have a big number plus a

89
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:43,283
small number and then on the left hand
side we have two copies of the big number

90
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:47,846
so that is going to be something larger,
now it's gonna be convenient it's gonna be

91
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:52,244
more obvious what's going on if I divide
both of these sides by two so that the

92
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:56,807
maximum of F of N and G of N is at least half of
F of N plus G of N that is at least half

93
00:06:56,807 --> 00:07:01,150
of the average and now we're pretty much
home free right so what does this say.

94
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,641
This says that for every possible N, the
maximums wedged between suitable multiples

95
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:11,201
of the sum. So one-half of F of N plus G
of N. There's a lower bound on the

96
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:15,502
maximum. This is just the second
inequality that we derived. And by the

97
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:20,294
first inequality that's bounded above by
once times the sum. And this holds no

98
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:25,148
matter what N is, [inaudible] at least
one. And this is exactly what it means to

99
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:29,755
prove that one function is theta of
another. We've shown that for all N, not

100
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:34,732
just for insuffiently large, but in fact
for all N. The pointwise maximum of F and

101
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:39,717
G is wedged between suitable constant
multiples of their sum. And again, just to

102
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:44,803
be explicit, the certifying choices of
constants are N-nought equals one. The

103
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:49,821
smaller constant is one half. And the
bigger constant equals one. And that

104
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,196
completes the proof.
