1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,430
So he's now put in a lot of work designing
and analyzing super fast algorithms for

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,434
reasoning about graphs. So in this
optional video, what I want to do is show

3
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:12,705
you why you might want such a primitive,
especially for computation on extremely

4
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:17,189
large graphs. Specifically, we're going to
look at the results of a famous study that

5
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:21,406
computes the strongly connected components
of the web graph. So what is the web

6
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:25,653
graph? Well, it's the graph in which the
vertices correspond to web pages. So for

7
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:30,034
example, I have my own web page where I,
you know, list my research papers, and

8
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:34,761
also links to courses such as this one And
the edges are going to be directed, and

9
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:39,431
they correspond precisely to hyperlinks.
So, the links that, bring you from one web

10
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:44,215
page to another. Note of course that these
are directed edges, where the tail is the

11
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:49,000
page that contains the hyperlink, and the
head is the pa, page that you go to if you

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,439
click the hyperlink, and so this is a
directed graph. So from my home page you

13
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,404
can get to my papers. You can get to my
courses. Sometimes I have random links up

14
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:03,103
to things I like, like say, my favorite
record store And of course for many of

15
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:07,630
these web pages there are additional links
going out and going in. So for example

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,157
from my papers I might link some to my
co-authors, some of my co-authors might be

17
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:16,741
linking from their home pages to me, or of
course there's web pages out there that

18
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:21,880
list the currently available free online
courses And so on So obviously this is

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,821
just part of a, massive, web graph, Just a
tiny, tiny piece of it. So the origins of

20
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:33,083
the web were probably around 1990 or so
but it started to really explode in the

21
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:37,965
mid'90s. And by the year 2000 it was
already beyond comprehension. Even though

22
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:43,164
in internet years the year 2000 is sort of
the Stone Age relative to right now,

23
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:47,983
relative to 2012 But still, even by 2000
people were so overwhelmed with the

24
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:52,738
massive scale of the web graph; they
wanted to understand anything about it,

25
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:57,166
even the most basic things. Of course one
issue with understanding what the graph

26
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:01,039
looks like is you don't even have it
locally, right? It's distributed over all

27
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,013
these different servers Over the entire
world. So the first thing people really

28
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:09,188
focused on when they wanted to answer this
question Was on techniques for crawling.

29
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:13,463
So having software which just follows lots
of hyperlinks Reports back to the home

30
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:17,387
base, from which you can assemble. At
least some kind of sketch of what this

31
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,908
graph actually is. So, but then the
question is Even once you have this

32
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:25,234
crawled information Even if, once you've
accessed A good chunk of the nodes and the

33
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:29,110
edges of this Of this network. What does
it look like? So what makes this a

34
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,491
difficult question, more difficult than,
say, for any other directed graph you

35
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:37,987
might encounter? Well, it's simply the
massive scale of the web graph, it's just

36
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:42,311
so big. So for the graph used in the
particular study I'm gonna discuss, you

37
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:46,576
know, like we said, it was in the year
2000, which was sort of the stone age

38
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:50,900
compared to 2012, so the graph was small,
relatively, but still, the graph was

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,338
really, really, big. So, it was something
like 200 million nodes and one billion

40
00:02:55,338 --> 00:03:00,082
edges, really, one and a half billion
edges. So the reference for the work I'm

41
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:04,333
gonna discuss is a paper by a number of
authors. The first author is Andrei Broder

42
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,583
And then he has many co-authors And this
was a paper that appeared in the Dub, Dub,

43
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,471
Dub conference of the year 2000. That's
the World Wide Web Conference And I

44
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:16,151
encourage you, those of you who are
interested, to go track down the, the

45
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:20,246
paper on line And read the original
source. So Andrei Broder the lead author.

46
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:24,342
At this time he was at a company that was
called Alta Vista. So how many of you

47
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:28,295
remember a company called Alta Vista?
Well, some of you, especially, you know,

48
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:32,806
the youngest ones among you maybe have
never heard of Alta Vista And the youngest

49
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:37,372
ones among you maybe can't even conceive
of a world in which we didn't have Google

50
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:42,158
But in fact there was a time when we had
Web Search that it would, but Google did

51
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,778
not yet exist. That was sort of in the,
you know, maybe 97 or so. And so this was

52
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:51,289
in the very embryonic years of Google And
this, this data set actually came out of,

53
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:55,190
out of Alta Vista instead. So [inaudible]
etc all wanted to get some answers to this

54
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,440
question. What does the web graph look
like? And they approached it in a few

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,057
ways, but the one I'm going to focus on
here is they asked, well. You know, what's

56
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:06,494
the most detailed structure we can get
about this web graph without doing an

57
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:11,098
infeasible amount of computation? Really
just sticking to linear time algorithms,

58
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:15,424
at, at the worst And what have we seen?
We've seen that in a directed graph you

59
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:20,139
can get full connectivity information just
really using [inaudible] first search. You

60
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,687
can compute strongly connected components
in linear time with small constants, and

61
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:29,806
that's one of the major things that they
did in this study. Now if you wanted to do

62
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:33,741
this same computation today you'd have one
thing going against you and one thing

63
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:37,530
going for you. The obvious thing that
you'd have going against you is that the

64
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,920
web is still very much bigger Than it was
here. Certainly by an order of magnitude

65
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,576
The thing that you'd have going for you is
now there's specialized systems which are

66
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:51,657
meant to operate on massive data sets And
in particular, they can do things like

67
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:55,739
compute connectivity information on graph
data. So what you have to remember, for

68
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:59,820
those of you who are aware of these terms,
in 2000, there was no map reduce. There

69
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,055
was no [inaudible]. There were no tools
for automated processing large data sets.

70
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:09,475
These guys really had to do it from
scratch. So let me tell you about what

71
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:14,508
Broder et al found when they did strong
connectivity computations one the web

72
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:19,541
graph. They explained their results in
what they called the bow tie picture of

73
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:25,271
the web. So let's begin with the center of
the knot of the bow tie. So in the middle

74
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:32,482
we have what we're gonna call a giant,
strongly connected component. With the

75
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:40,823
interpretation being this is the core of
the web in some sense. Alright, so all of

76
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:44,823
you know what a, an SCC is at this point.
A strongly connected component is the reg

77
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:48,872
ion from which you can get from any point
to any other point along a directed path.

78
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:52,750
So in the context of the web graph, with
this giant SCC, what this means is that

79
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,726
from any webpage inside this [inaudible]
you can get to any other webpage inside

80
00:05:56,726 --> 00:06:00,550
this [inaudible] just by traversing a
sequence of hyperlinks. And hopefully, it

81
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,313
doesn't strike you as too surprising that
a big chunk of the web is strongly

82
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:08,222
connected, is well connected in this sense
Right? So if you think about all these

83
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:11,887
different universities in the world. You
know, probably all of the web pages

84
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:15,748
corresponding to all of the different
universities. You can get from any one

85
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:20,041
place to any other place For example, from
the homepage on which I put my papers,

86
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:24,955
that often include links to my co-authors
which very commonly are other universities

87
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:29,423
so that already provides a web link from
some Stanford page to some page at say,

88
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:33,946
Berkeley or Cornell or whatever and of
course I'm just a one person. I'm just one

89
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:38,358
of many faculty members at Stanford. So
you put all of these together, you would

90
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:42,770
expect all of the different SCCs
corresponding to different universities to

91
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,458
collapse into a single one and so on for
other sectors s well. An then of course if

92
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:51,589
you knew that a huge chunk of the web was
in the same shelling ham component, let's

93
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:55,116
say ten percent of the web, which would be
tens of millions of web pages, you

94
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:59,147
wouldn't expect there to be a second one,
right, it would be super weird if there

95
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:03,329
were two different blobs, ten million web
pages each, that somehow were not mutually

96
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:07,214
reachable from each other. That would
just, all it takes to collapse two SCCs

97
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:11,230
into one, is a lone arc going from one to
the other, and then a lone arc in the

98
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,555
reverse direction. And then those two SCCs
collapse into one. So we do expect a giant

99
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:19,520
SCC, just sort of thinking anecdotally
about what the web looks like, and then

100
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,640
once we realize there's one giant SCC, we
don't expect there to be more than one.

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,866
Alright, so is that the whole story? Is
the web graph just one big SCC? Well, one

102
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:32,148
of the perhaps intere sting findings of
this [inaudible] paper is that, you know

103
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:35,941
there is a giant SCC, but it doesn't
actually take up the whole web, or

104
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:40,439
anything really that close to the entire
web. So what else would there be in such a

105
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,667
picture? Well, there's the other two ends
of the bow tie. Which are called the in

106
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:51,207
and the out regions In the out regions,
you have a bunch of strongly connecting

107
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:55,561
components, not giant SCCs. We've
established that shouldn't be any other

108
00:07:55,561 --> 00:08:00,459
giant SCCs, but small SCCs Which you can
reach from the giant strongly connecting

109
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:05,115
component, but from which you cannot go
back to the giant strongly connecting

110
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:10,612
component. I encourage you to think about
what types of web sites you would expect

111
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:15,007
to see in this out part of the bow tie.
I'll give you once example, very often if

112
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:19,296
you look at a corporate site including
those of well known corporations, which

113
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:23,055
you would definitely expect to be
reachable from the giant SEC. There's

114
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:27,079
actually a corporate policy that no
hyperlinks can go from something in the

115
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,945
corporate site to something outside the
corporate site. So that means the

116
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:35,445
corporate site is going to be a collection
of web pages which are certainly strongly

117
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:39,205
connected, because it's a major
corporation you can certainly get there

118
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:43,084
from. The giant has [cough], but because
of this corporate policy you can't get

119
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:48,289
back out. Symmetrically, in the in part of
the bow tie, you have a strong [inaudible]

120
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:53,564
of components, generally small ones, from
which you can reach the giant SCC But you

121
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:58,256
cannot get through them from the giant
SCC. Again I encourage you to think about

122
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:02,577
all the different types of web-pages you
might expect to see in this import of the

123
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:06,898
bow-tie [inaudible]. Certainly one really
obvious example would be new web-pages. So

124
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:11,062
if you just create something, and then,
you know if I just created a web-page and

125
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:15,279
pointed it to Stanford University that
would immediately be in this in-component,

126
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,236
in this in-collection of components. Now,
if you think about it, this does not

127
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:23,504
exhaust all of the possibilities of where
notes can log. There's a few other cases.

128
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:29,104
They frankly are pretty weird, but they're
there. You can have passive hyperlinks

129
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:36,343
which bypass the giant FCC, and go
straight from the in part of the Bowtie to

130
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:43,997
the out part So [inaudible] suggested
calling these tubes. And then there's also

131
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:49,733
a kind of very curious outgrowths going
out of the in component, but which don't

132
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:55,541
make it all the way to the giant SCC, and
similarly there's stuff which goes into

133
00:09:55,541 --> 00:10:00,417
the out component And [inaudible]
recommended calling these strange

134
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:09,336
creatures' tendrils And then in fact you
can also just have some weird isolated

135
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:14,963
islands of SCCs that are not connected
even weekly to the giant SCC. So this is

136
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:20,956
the picture that emerged from Broderall's
strong component computation on the web

137
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:27,023
graph and here's qualitatively some of the
main findings that they came up with. So

138
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:33,235
first of all, that picture on the previous
slide I drew roughly to scale in the sense

139
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:38,862
that all four parts, so the giant SCC, the
in-part, the out-part and then their

140
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:44,636
residual stuff; the tubes and tendrils,
have roughly the same size. You know, more

141
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:50,454
or less 25 percent of the nodes in the
graph. I think this surprised some people.

142
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:55,046
I think some people might have thought
that the core that the giant SCC might

143
00:10:55,046 --> 00:11:00,061
have been a little bit bigger than just 25
or 28%. But [inaudible] is a lot of other

144
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:05,939
stuff outside of the stronger connected
core. You might wonder if this is, is just

145
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:10,649
an artifact of the, this data set being
from the Stone Age, being from 2000 or so.

146
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,889
But, people have rerun this experiment on,
on the web graph again in later years. And

147
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:20,717
of course the numbers are changing because
the graph is growing rapidly, but these

148
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:24,838
qualitatively findings, qualitative
findings have seemed pretty stable,

149
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:29,789
throughout subsequent, reevaluations of
the structure of the web. On the other

150
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,700
hand, while the. Core of the web is not as
big as you might have expected. It's

151
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,740
extremely well connected Perhaps better
connected than you might have expected.

152
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,366
Now you'd be right to ask the question.
You know, what could I mean by unusually

153
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:47,313
well connected? We've already established
that this giant core of the web is strong

154
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:50,939
and connected. You can get from any one
place to any other place, via a sequence

155
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,377
of hyperlinks. What else could you want?
Well, in fact. It has a very richer notion

156
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:59,225
of connectivity called the small world
property. So let me tell you about the

157
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:03,073
small world property or the phenomenon
colloquially known as six-degrees of

158
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:07,175
separation. So this is an idea which had
been in the air at least since the early

159
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:11,370
twentieth century, but it really it was
kind of studied. In a major way and

160
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,820
popularized by [inaudible]. Norgren was a
social scientist back in 1967. So Norgren

161
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,821
was interested in understanding you know
are people at great distance in fact

162
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:26,117
connected by short chains of
intermediaries. So the way he evaluated

163
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:31,503
this he ran the following experiment. He
gave he identified a friend in Boston

164
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:36,811
Massachusetts. A doctor I believe And so
this was gonna be the target And then he

165
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:41,824
identified a bunch of people who were
thought to be far away both culturally and

166
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:46,837
geographically. Specifically Omaha So for
those of you who don't live in the US just

167
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:51,504
take it on faith that many people in the
US would regard Boston and, and Omaha as

168
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:56,574
being fairly far apart geographically and
otherwise And what he did is he wrote each

169
00:12:56,574 --> 00:13:01,472
of these residents of Omaha the following
letter. He said look here's the name and

170
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:05,624
address of this doctor who lives in
Boston. Okay, your job is to get this

171
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:09,896
letter to this doctor in Boston. Now,
you're not allowed to mail the letter

172
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:14,630
directly to the doctor, instead you need
to mail it to an intermediary, someone who

173
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,133
you know on a first name basis. So of
course if you knew the doctor on a first

174
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:23,752
name basis you could mail it straight to
them, but that was very unlikely. So you

175
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:27,711
know what people would do in Omaha is,
they'd say, well. I don't know any

176
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:31,327
doctors, or I don't know anyone in Boston,
but at least I know somebody in

177
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:35,437
Pittsburgh, and at least that's closer to
Boston than Omaha, that's further eastward

178
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:39,399
Or maybe someone would say, well I don't
really know anyone at E ast coast, but at

179
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,509
least I do know some doctors here in Omaha
And so they give the letter to somebody

180
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:47,323
depending on a first name basis in Omaha
And then, the situation would repeat.

181
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:51,235
Whoever got the letter, again they'd be
given the same instructions: If you know

182
00:13:51,235 --> 00:13:54,900
this doctor in Boston on a first name
basis, send him the letter. Otherwise,

183
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,060
pass the letter on to somebody who seems
more likely closer to them then you are

184
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,935
Now of course many of these letters never
reached their destination but shocking at

185
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:08,196
least to me is that a lot of them did. So
something like 25 percent at least of the

186
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:12,568
letters that they started with made it all
the way to Boston. Which I think says

187
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:17,212
something about people in the late sixties
just having more free time on their hands

188
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:21,856
than they do in the early 21th century And
I find this hard to imagine but it's a

189
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:25,940
fact. So you had dozens and dozens of
letters reaching this doctor in Boston.

190
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,265
And they were able to trace exactly which
path of individuals the letter went along

191
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:34,384
before it eventually reached this doctor
in Boston And so then what they did is

192
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:38,452
they looked at the distribution of chain
links. So how many intermediaries were

193
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:42,777
required to get from some random person in
Omaha to this doctor in Boston? Some were

194
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:46,588
as few as two. Some were as big as nine
But the average number of hops, the

195
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:50,810
average number of intermediaries was in
the range of five and one-half or six And

196
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,032
so this is what has given rise to the
colloquialism even the name of a popular

197
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:59,599
play the six degrees of separation. So
that's the origin myth. That's where this

198
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:04,084
phrase comes from. These sorts of
experiments with physical letters But now,

199
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:08,451
in network science, the small world
property is meant to be a network, which,

200
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:13,169
on the one hand, is richly connected But
also, in some sense, there are enough cues

201
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:17,886
about which links are likely to get closer
to some target. So that if you need to

202
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:22,545
route information from point a, to point
b. Not only is there a short path But if

203
00:15:22,545 --> 00:15:27,191
you, in some sense, follow your nose, then
you'll actually exhibit a short path. So

204
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:31,386
in some sense, routing information is easy
in small world networks And this is

205
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:35,690
exactly the property that [inaudible]
identified with [inaudible] SCC, very rich

206
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,046
with short paths and if you want to get
from point A to point B just follow your

207
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:44,242
nose and you'll do great. You don't need a
very sophisticated [inaudible] path

208
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:48,462
algorithm to find a short path. Some of
you may have heard of Stanley Migrim, not

209
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:52,630
for this small world experiment but for
another famous, or maybe infamous, he did

210
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,850
earlier in the Sixties which consisted
into tricking volunteers into thinking

211
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,226
they were subjecting other human beings to
massive doses of electric shocks. So that

212
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:05,498
wound up, you know, ended up causing a
rewrite to certain standards of ethics in

213
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:09,770
experimental psychology. You don't hear
about that so much when people are talking

214
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:14,201
about networks, but that's another reason
why Migram's work is well known And just

215
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:18,395
as a point of contrast, outside of this
[inaudible] opponent which has this rich

216
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:22,275
small world structure very poor
conductivity in other parts of the web

217
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:26,090
graph. So there's a lot of cool research
going on these days about the study of

218
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,543
information networks like, like the web
graph. So they want you to get the

219
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:33,235
impression that the entire interaction
between algorithms and thinking about

220
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:37,168
information networks is just being as one
strong component competition in 2000. Of

221
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:41,148
course, there is all kind of interactions,
I have just singled one out that was easy

222
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:45,176
to explain and also highly influential and
interesting back in the day But you know

223
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:49,013
these days; lots of stuffs are going on.
People are thinking about information

224
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:52,801
networks kind of different ways and of
course algorithms and almost everything

225
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:56,590
explained a very fundamental law. So let
me just dash off to a few examples. I'm

226
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,894
Whetting your appetite, maybe you want to
go explore this topic in greater depth

227
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,032
outside of this course. So one super
interesting question is, rather than

228
00:17:05,032 --> 00:17:09,121
looking at a static snapshot of the web
Like we were doing so far in this video

229
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:12,932
Alright, the web is changing all the time.
New pages are getting created, new links

230
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:17,023
are getting created and destroyed and so
on And How does this evolution proceed?

231
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:21,780
Can we have a mathematical model which
faithfully reproduces the most important

232
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,859
first order properties of this
evolutionary process? So the second issue

233
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,815
is to not think not just about the
dynamics of the graph itself, but the

234
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,377
dynamics of information that gets carried
by the graph. And you could ask this both

235
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:38,828
about the web graph and about other social
networks like say, Facebook or Twitter.

236
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:42,895
Another really important topic which
there's been a lot of work on, but we

237
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,566
still don't fully understand by any means,
is getting at the finer grain structure in

238
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,896
networks, including the web graph And
particularly what we really like to do is

239
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:56,217
that full proof method for identifying
communities. So groups of notes is going

240
00:17:56,217 --> 00:18:00,264
to be web pages and web graph for
individuals and social network which we

241
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:04,367
should think of as grouped together. We
discussed this when we talked about

242
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:08,250
applications of cuts. One motivation of
cuts is to identify communities

243
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,189
everything. Communities has been
relatively densely connected inside and

244
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:16,619
sparsely connected outside And that's just
a, and that's just baby step, really we

245
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,721
need much better techniques for both
defining and computing communities in

246
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:25,402
these kind of networks. So I think these
questions are super interesting, both from

247
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:29,547
a mathematical/technical level, but also
they're very timely. Answering them really

248
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:33,641
helps us understand our world better.
Unfortunately these are gonna be well

249
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:37,584
outside the course of just the bread and
better design analysis of algorithms,

250
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,274
which is what the, on task with covering
here. But I will leave you with a

251
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:45,369
reference of a book that I recommend if
you want to read more about these topics

252
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:48,907
Namely the, quite recent book by David
Easley and Jon Kleinberg, called

253
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:50,323
"Networks, Crowds, and Markets."
