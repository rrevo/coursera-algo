00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,403
Hi, my name's Tim Roughgarden. 
I'm a professor here at Stanford 

2
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:06,283
University. 
And I'd like to welcome you to this first 

3
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:09,860
course on the Design and Analysis of 
Algorithms. 

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,960
Now, I imagine many of you are already 
clear on your reasons for taking this 

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,090
course. 
But let me begin by justifying this 

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,527
course's existence. 
And giving you some reasons why you 

7
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:24,330
should be highly motivated to learn about 
algorithms. 

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,775
So what is an algorithm anyways? 
Basically it's a set of well defined 

9
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:34,380
rules, a recipe in effect for solving 
some computational problem. 

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,746
Maybe you have a bunch of numbers and you 
want to rearrange them so that they're in 

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,587
sorted order. 
Maybe you have a roadmap and an origin 

12
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:45,292
and a destination And you want to compute 
the shortest path from that origin to 

13
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:49,450
that destination. 
May be you face a number of different 

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,232
tasks that need to be completed by 
certain deadlines and you ant to know in 

15
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:57,310
what order you should accomplish the 
task. 

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,420
So that you complete them all by their 
respective deadlines. 

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,192
So why study algorithms? 
Well first of all, understanding the 

18
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:09,284
basics of algorithms and the related 
field of data structures is essential for 

19
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:14,570
doing serious work in pretty much any 
branch of computer science. 

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,523
This is the reason why here at Stanford, 
this course is required for every single 

21
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:23,436
degree that the department offers. 
The bachelors degree the masters degree 

22
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:27,102
and also the PHD. 
To give you a few examples routing and 

23
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:32,935
communication networks piggybacks on 
classical shortest path algorithms. 

24
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:36,751
The effectiveness of public key 
cryptography relies on that of 

25
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:41,746
number-theoretic algorithms. 
Computer graphics needs the computational 

26
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:45,330
primitives supplied by geometric 
algorithms. 

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,890
Database indices rely on balanced search 
tree data structures. 

28
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,508
Computational biology uses dynamic 
programming algorithms to measure genome 

29
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:56,570
similarity. 
And the list goes on. 

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,420
Second, algorithms play a key role in 
modern technological innovation. 

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,574
To give just one obvious example, search 
engines use a tapestry of algorithms to 

32
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:12,542
efficiently compute the relevance of 
various webpages to it's given search 

33
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:16,573
query. 
The most famous such algorithm is the 

34
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:20,030
page rank algorithm currently in use by 
Google. 

35
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,368
Indeed in a December 2010 report to the 
United States White House, the 

36
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:29,770
President's counsel of advisers on 
science and technology argued that in 

37
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,314
many areas performance gains due to 
improvements in algorithms have vastly 

38
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:42,520
exceeded event he dramatic performance 
gains due to increased processor speeds. 

39
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,710
Third, although this is outside of the 
score, the scope of this course. 

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,254
Algorithms are increasingly being used to 
provide a novel lens on processes outside 

41
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:58,353
of computer science and technology. 
For example, the study of quantum 

42
00:02:58,353 --> 00:03:02,400
computation has provided a new 
Computational viewpoint on quantum 

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,346
mechanics. 
Price fluctuations in economic markets 

44
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:12,008
can be fruitfully viewed as an algorthmic 
process and even evolution can be 

45
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:18,050
usefully thought of as a surprisingly 
effect search algorthim. 

46
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,326
The last two reasons for studying 
algorthims might sound flippant but both 

47
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:26,678
have more than a grain of truth to them. 
I don't know about you, but back when I 

48
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:30,622
was a student, my favorite classes were 
always the challenging ones that, after I 

49
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:34,218
struggled through them, left me feeling a 
few IQ points smarter than when I 

50
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:39,246
started. 
I hope this course provides a similar 

51
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:43,115
experience for many of you. 
Finally, I hope that by the end of the 

52
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:46,958
course I'll have converted some of you to 
agree with me that the design and 

53
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:53,089
analysis of algorithms is simply fun. 
It's an endeavor that requires a rare 

54
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:58,180
blend of precision and creativity. 
It can certainly be frustrating at times, 

55
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,112
but it's also highly addictive. 
So let's descend from these lofty 

56
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:07,897
generalities and get much more concrete. 
And let's remember that we've all been 

57
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:12,950
learning about and using algorithims 
since we were little kids.
