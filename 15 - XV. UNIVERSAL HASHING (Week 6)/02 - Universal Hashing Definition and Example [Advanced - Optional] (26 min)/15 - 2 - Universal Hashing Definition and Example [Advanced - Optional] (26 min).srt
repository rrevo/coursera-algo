1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,028
So now that we understand why we can't
have a single hash function which always

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:08,042
does well at every single data set, that
is every hash function is subject to a

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,074
pathological data sets. We'll discuss the
randomize solution of how we can have a

4
00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:16,019
family of hash functions and if you make a
real time decision about which hash

5
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,055
function to use, you're guaranteed to do
well on average, no matter what the data

6
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:25,427
is. So let me remind you of the three
prong plan that I have for this part of

7
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:29,539
the material. So in this video, we'll be
covering the first two. So part one, which

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,936
we'll accomplish in the next slide, will
be to propose a mathematical definition of

9
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:38,898
a good random hash function. So formerly,
we're going to define a universal family

10
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:43,168
of hash functions. Now, what makes this
definition useful, well, two things. And

11
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:48,617
so, part two, we'll show that there are
examples of simple and easy to compute

12
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:52,906
hash functions that meet this definition,
that are universal in the sense described

13
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:56,999
on the next slide. So that's important.
And in the third part, which we'll do in

14
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:01,271
the next video, will be the mathematical
analysis of the performance of hashing,

15
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:05,549
specifically with chaining when you use
universal hashing. And we'll show that if

16
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,957
you pick a random function from a
universal family, then, the expected

17
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:12,764
performance of all of the operations are
constant. Assuming, of course, of the

18
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:17,172
number of buckets is comparable to the
number of objects in the hash table which

19
00:01:17,172 --> 00:01:21,939
we saw earlier is a necessary condition
for good performance. So let's go ahead

20
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,157
and get started and let's say what we mean
by a good random hash function. So for

21
00:01:26,157 --> 00:01:30,965
this definition, we'll assume that the
universe is fixed. So maybe it's IP

22
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:35,707
addresses, maybe it's our friends names.
Maybe it's configurations of a chessboard,

23
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:40,143
whatever. But there's some fixed universe
u and we'll also assume we've decided on

24
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:47,322
the number of buckets n. And we call the
set H universal if and only if it meets

25
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:52,977
the following condition. In English, the
condition says that for each pair of

26
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:58,163
distinct elements, the probab ility that
they collide should be no larger than with

27
00:01:58,163 --> 00:02:03,520
the gold standard of perfectly uniform
random hashing. So for all distinct keys

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,854
from the universe, call them x and y, what
we want is that the probability if we

29
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:16,382
choose a random hash function, h, from the
set script h, the probability that x and y

30
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:22,176
collide. And again, just to be clear, what
that means is that, x and y hash to

31
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:30,961
exactly the same bucket under this hash
function h, this should be no more than

32
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:38,334
1/n, and don't forget n is the number of
buckets. Again, to interpret this, you

33
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:42,835
know, 1/n, where does this come from? So,
we said earlier that an impractical but in

34
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:47,820
some sense, gold standard hash function
would be to just independently for each

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,007
key, assign it bucket uniformly and random
with different keys being assigned

36
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,055
independently. Remember the reason this is
not a practical hash function is because,

37
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:59,006
you'd have to remember where everybody
went. And then that would basically

38
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:02,033
require maintaining a list which would
devolve to the list solution, so you don't

39
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:05,070
want that. You want hash functions where
you have to store almost nothing and we

40
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,044
can evaluate them in constant time. But,
if we throw out those requirements of

41
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:13,093
small space and small time then, random
function should spread stuff out pretty

42
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:17,054
evenly, right? I mean that's what they are
doing. They're throwing darts completely

43
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:21,003
at random at these n buckets. So what
would be the collision probability of two

44
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:24,034
given keys say, of Alice and of Bob if you
are doing everything independently and

45
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:28,084
uniformly at random. Well, you know, first
Alice shows up and it goes to some totally

46
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:32,062
random bucket, say, bucket number
seventeen. Now, Bob shows up. So, what's

47
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:37,218
the probability that it collides with
Alice? Well, we have these n buckets that

48
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:40,765
Bob could go to, each is equally likely,
and there's a collision between Alice and

49
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:45,551
Bob if and only if Bob goes to bucket
seventeen. Since, each bucket's equally

50
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:49,522
likely, that's only a one in n
probability. So really what this condition

51
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:53,696
is saying, is that, for each pair of
elements, the collision probability should

52
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:59,899
be as small, as good as with the holy
grail of perfectly random hashing. So this

53
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:04,704
is a pretty subtle definition, perhaps the
most subtle one that we see in this entire

54
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:09,443
course. So, to help you get some facility
with this, and to force you to think about

55
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:13,684
it a little deeply, the next quiz which is
probably harder than a typical in class

56
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:17,535
quiz, asks you to compare this definition
of universal hashing with another

57
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:21,719
definition and ask you to figure out to
what extent they're the same definition.

58
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:26,676
So the correct answer to this quiz
question is the third one that there are

59
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:32,211
hash function families h, that satisfy the
condition on this slide that are not

60
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:37,138
universal. On the other hand, there are
hash function families H, which satisfy

61
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:42,708
this property and are universal. So, I'm
going to give you an example of each. I'd

62
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:47,618
encourage you to think carefully about why
this is an example and a non-example

63
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:52,547
offline. So an easy example to show that
sometimes the answer is yes, you have

64
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:57,659
universal hash function families h, which
also satisfy this property of the slide,

65
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:02,832
would be to just take H to be the set of
all functions from mapping the universe to

66
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:08,030
the number of buckets. So that's an awful
lot of functions, that's a huge set, but

67
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,448
it's a set nonetheless. And, by symmetry
of having all of the functions, it both

68
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:16,504
satisfies the property of this slide. It
is indeed true that exactly a one on one

69
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:21,604
refraction of all functions, map arbitrary
key k to arbitrary bucket i. And by the

70
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:26,715
same reasoning, by the same symmetry
properties, this is universal. So really,

71
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:31,414
if you think about it choosing a function
at random function from H, is now just

72
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,707
choosing a completely random function. So
it's exactly what we've been calling

73
00:05:34,707 --> 00:05:38,302
perfect, random hashing. And as we
discussed in the last slide, that would

74
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:44,039
indeed have a collision probability of
exactly 1/n for each pair of distinct

75
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,639
keys. So, this shows sometimes you can
have both this property and be universal.

76
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,049
An example where you have the property in
this slide, but you're not universa l,

77
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:56,937
would be to take h to be a quite small
family, a family of exactly n functions,

78
00:05:56,937 --> 00:06:01,269
each of which is a constant function. So
it's going to be one function which always

79
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:05,020
maps everything to bucket zero, that's a
totally stupid hash function. There's

80
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,034
going to be another hash function which
always maps everything to bucket number

81
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:13,504
one, that's a different but also totally
stupid hash function, and so on. And then

82
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:18,031
the end function will be the constant
function that always maps everything to

83
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:23,488
bucket n-1. And if you think about it,
this very silly set H does indeed satisfy

84
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:28,750
this very reasonable looking property on
this slide. Fix any key, fix any bucket,

85
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,133
you know say bucket number 31 what's the
probability that you pick a hash function

86
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:37,193
that maps this key to bucket number 31?
Well, independent of what the key is, it's

87
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:40,669
going to be the probability that you pick
the constant hash function whose output is

88
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:43,544
always 31. Since there's n different
constant functions, there's a one in n

89
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:48,192
probability. So, that's an example showing
that in some sense, this is not as useful

90
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:52,107
a property as the property of universal
hashing. So this is really not what you

91
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:55,759
wanted. This is not strong enough.
Universal hashing, that's what you want

92
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,862
for strong guarantees. So now that we've
spent some time trying to assimilate

93
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:03,413
probably the subtlest definition we've
seen so far in this class, let me let you

94
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:07,423
in on a little secret about the role of
definitions in mathematics. So on the one

95
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:12,415
hand, I think mathematical definitions
often get short shrift, especially in, you

96
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:16,206
know, the popular discussion of
mathematical research. That said, you

97
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:20,572
know, it's easy to come up with one reason
why that's true, which is that any schmo

98
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:24,800
can come up and write down an mathematical
definition. Nobody's stopping you. So,

99
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,626
what you really need to do is you need to
prove that a mathematical definition is

100
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:33,715
useful. So how do you indicate usefulness
of a definition? Well you gotta do two

101
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:38,301
things. First of all, you have to show
that the definition is satisfied by

102
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:42,532
objects of interest. For us right now,
objects of interest, are hash functions,

103
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:46,594
we might imagine implementing. So they
should be easy to store, easy to evaluate.

104
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:50,596
So there better be such hash functions
meaning, that complicated universal hash

105
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:55,678
function definition. The second thing is,
is something good better happen if you

106
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:59,072
meet the definition. And in the context of
hashing, what good thing do we want to

107
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:02,092
have happen? We want to have good
performance. So those are the two things

108
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:06,035
that I owe you in these lectures. First of
all, a construction of practical hash

109
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:09,056
functions that meet that definition,
that's what we'll start on right now.

110
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:13,078
Second of all, why meeting that definition
is a sufficient condition for good hash

111
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:18,096
table performance. That will be the next
video. So in this example, I'm going to

112
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:24,023
focus on IP addresses although the hash
function construction is general, as I

113
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:30,025
hope will be reasonably clear. And as many
of you know, an IP address is 32 bit

114
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:35,009
integer consisting of four different eight
bit parts. So let's just go ahead and

115
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,081
think of an IP address as a four two fold,
the way you often see it. And since each

116
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:45,386
of the four parts is eight bits, it's
going to be a number between zero and 255.

117
00:08:45,386 --> 00:08:49,072
And the hash function that we're going to
construct, it's really not going to be so

118
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:51,855
different than the quick and dirty
functions as we talked about in the last

119
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:56,843
video although in this case we'll be able
to prove that the hash function family is

120
00:08:56,843 --> 00:08:59,819
in fact, universal. And we're again going
to use the same compression function.

121
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,879
We're going to take the modulas with
respect to a prime number of buckets. The

122
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,088
only difference is we're going to multiply
these xi's by a random set of

123
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:11,851
coefficients. We're going to take a, a
random linear combination of x1, x2, x3

124
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:16,002
and x4. So I'm going to be a little more
precise. So we're going to choose a number

125
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:19,589
of buckets, n, and as we say over and
over, the number of buckets should be

126
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,482
chosen so it's in the same ball park of
the number of objects you are storing. So

127
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:27,499
you know, let's say that n should be
roughly double the number of objects that

128
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:32,449
you are storing as initial rule of thumb.
So, for example, maybe we only want to

129
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:37,049
maintain something in the ball park of 500
IP addresses and we can choose n to be a

130
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:43,003
prime like 997. So here's the
construction. Remember, we want to produce

131
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:47,091
not just one hash function, but the
definition is about a universal family of

132
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:52,074
hash functions. So we need a whole set of
hash functions that we're ultimately going

133
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:58,004
to chose one member from, at random. So,
how do we construct a whole bunch of hash

134
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:04,064
functions in a simple way? Here's how we
do it. So you define one hash function,

135
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:11,081
which I'm going to note by h sub a, a here
is a four tuple. The components of which

136
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:19,089
I'm going to call a1, a2, a3 and a4. And,
all of the components of a are integers

137
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:26,089
between zero and n-1. So they're exactly
in correspondence with the indices of the

138
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:32,009
buckets. So if we have 997 buckets, then
each of these ai's is an integer between

139
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:37,014
zero and 996. So it's clear that this
defines, you know, a whole bunch of

140
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:42,062
functions. So in fact, for each of the
four coefficients, that's four independent

141
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:47,278
choices, you have n options. Okay so each
of the integers between zero and n-1 for

142
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,062
each of the four coefficients. So that's
fine, not giving a name to end of the four

143
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:56,084
different functions, but what is any given
function? How do you actually evaluate one

144
00:10:56,084 --> 00:11:00,048
of these functions? Just remember what a
hash function is supposed to do. Remember

145
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:04,035
you know, how it type checks it takes as
input something from the universe in this

146
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:09,013
case an IP address, and outputs a bucket
number. And the way we evaluate the hash

147
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:14,558
function h sub a, and remember a here is a
4-tuple. And remember IP address is also a

148
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:19,258
4-tuple, okay, so each component of the IP
address is between zero and 255. Each

149
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:25,095
component of a is between zero and n-1, so
for example, between zero and 996. And

150
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:29,469
what we do is just take the dot products
or the inner products of the vector a and

151
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:34,369
the vector x, and then we take the modulus
with respect the number of buckets. So

152
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:45,773
that is we take a1  x1 + a2  x2 + a3 
x3 +a4  x4. Now of course, remember the

153
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,982
x's lie be tween zero and 255, the ai's
lie between the zero and n-1, so say zero

154
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:54,743
and 996, you know, so you do these form of
multiplications now make it a pretty big

155
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:59,734
number, you might well over shoot the
number of buckets n. So to get back in the

156
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:04,163
range of what the buckets are actually
indexed that in the end we take the

157
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:07,628
module, modulus the number of buckets. So
in the end we do output, a number between

158
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:13,294
zero and n-1 as desired. So that's a set
of a whole bunch of hash functions, n to

159
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:17,310
the fourth hash functions. And each one
meets the criteria of being a good hash

160
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,053
function from an implementation
perspective, right? So remember, we don't

161
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:25,097
want to have to store much to evaluate a
function. And for a given hash function in

162
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:30,013
this family, all we gotta remember are the
coefficients, a1, a2, a3 and a4. So you

163
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:34,051
just gotta remember these four numbers.
And then to evaluate a hash function on an

164
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:38,041
IP address, we clearly do a constant
amount of work. We just do these four

165
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:42,065
multiplications, the three additions, and
then taking the modulus by the number of

166
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:47,008
buckets n. So it's constant time to
evaluate, constant space to store. And

167
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:51,084
what's cool is, using just these very
simple hash functions which are constant

168
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:56,291
time to evaluate and constant space to
store, this is already enough to meet the

169
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:01,020
definition of a universal family of hash
functions. So this fulfills the first

170
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,005
promise that I owed you, after subjecting
you to that definition of universal

171
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:08,071
hashing. Remember the first promise was,
there are simple, there are useful

172
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:12,037
examples that meet the definition, and
then of course, I still owe you why.

173
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:16,032
Meaning this definition is useful, why
does it leave the good performance. But I

174
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:20,038
want to conclude, this video of actually
proving this theorem to you, arguing that

175
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:24,117
this is, in fact, a universal family of
hash functions. Right. So this should be a

176
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:28,010
mostly complete proof and certainly will
have all of the conceptual ingredients of

177
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,482
why the proof works There will be one spot
where I'm a little hand-wavy because we

178
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:34,438
need a little number theory, and I don't
want to have a big detour into number

179
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:38,363
theory. And if you think about it, you
shouldn't be surprised that basic number

180
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:42,153
theory plays at least some role. Like as I
said, we should choose the number of

181
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:46,212
buckets to be prime. So that means at some
point in the proof, you should expect us

182
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:50,046
to use the assumption that n is prime. And
pretty much always you're going to use

183
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:53,099
that assumption will involve at least
elementary number theory, okay? But I'll

184
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:57,693
be clear about where I'm being hand-wavy.
So what do we have to prove? Let's just

185
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:02,420
quickly review a definition of a universal
hash function. So we have our set h that

186
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,450
we, that we know exactly what it is. What
does it mean that it's universal? It means

187
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:10,090
for each pair of distinct keys, so in our
context it's for each pair of IP

188
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,083
addresses, the probability that a random
hash function from our family script h

189
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:19,077
causes a collision, maps these two IP
addresses to the same bucket should be no

190
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:24,811
worse than with perfectly random hashing.
So no worse than 1/n where n is the number

191
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:29,500
of buckets, say like 997. So, the
definition we need to meet is a condition

192
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,692
for every pair of distinct keys. So let's
just start by fixing two distinct keys. So

193
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:39,461
I'm going to assume for this proof that
these two IP addresses differ in their

194
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,580
fourth component. That is that I'm going
to assume that x4 is different than y4. So

195
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,409
I hope that it's intuitively clear that,
you know, it shouldn't matter, you know,

196
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:50,834
which, which set of 8-bits I'm looking at.
So they're different IP addresses. They

197
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:54,724
differ somewhere. If I really wanted, I
could have four cases that were totally

198
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:57,975
identical depending on whether they differ
in the first eight bits, the next 8-bits,

199
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:01,543
the next 8-bits, or the last 8-bits. I'm
going to show you one case, because the

200
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:04,871
other three are the same. So let's just
think of the last 8-bits as being

201
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,123
different. And now, remember what the
definition asked us to prove. It asked us

202
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:12,784
to prove that the probability that these
two IP addresses are going to collide is

203
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:17,891
at most, 1/n. So we need an upper bound on
the collision probability w ith respect to

204
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:22,336
a random hash function from our set of n
to the fourth hash functions. So I want to

205
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:27,023
be clear on the quantifiers. We're
thinking about two fixed IP addresses. So

206
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:32,008
for example, the IP address for the New
York Times website and the IP address for

207
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:37,216
the CNN website. We're asking for these
two fixed IP addresses, what fraction of

208
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:42,610
our hash functions cause them to collide,
right? We'll have some hash functions

209
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,188
which map the New York Times and CNN IP
addresses to the same bucket, and we'll

210
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:51,590
have other hash functions which do not map
those two IP addresses to the same bucket.

211
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,135
And we're trying to say, that the
overwhelming majority, sends them to

212
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,025
different buckets, only a 1/n fraction at
most, sends them to the same bucket. So

213
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:06,049
we're asking about the probability for the
choice of a random hash function from our

214
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:11,047
set h that the function maps the two IP
addresses to the same place. So the next

215
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:16,032
step is just algebra. I'm just going to
take this equation which indicates when

216
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:20,086
the two IP addresses collide over a hash
function. I'm going to expand the

217
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:24,150
definition of a hash function, remember
it's just this inner product modulo the

218
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,919
number of buckets n, and I am going to
rewrite this condition in a more

219
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,266
convenient way. Alright, so after the
algebra, and the dust has settled. We're

220
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:38,249
left with this equation being equivalent
to the two IP addresses colliding. So

221
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:42,817
again, we're interested in the fraction of
choices of a1, a2, a3, and a4, such that

222
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:47,329
this condition holds, right? Sometimes
it'll hold for some choices of the ai's,

223
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:51,460
sometimes it won't hold for other choices
and we're going to show that it almost

224
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,814
never holds. Okay, so it fails for all but
a 1/n fraction of the choices of the ai's.

225
00:16:56,814 --> 00:16:59,676
So next we're going to do something a
little sneaky. This trick is sometimes

226
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:03,273
called the Principle of Deferred
Decisions. And the idea is when you have a

227
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:08,504
bunch of random coin flips, it's sometimes
convenient to flip some but not all of

228
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:12,552
them. So sometimes fixing parts of the
randomness clarifies the role that the

229
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:16,347
remaining randomness is going to play .
That's what's going to happen here. So

230
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:21,266
let's go ahead and flip the coins, which
tell us the random choice of a1, a2, and

231
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:25,560
a3. So again remember, in the definition
of a universal hash function, you analyze

232
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,090
collision probability under a random
choice of a hash function. What does it

233
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,172
mean to choose a random hash function for
us? It means a random choice of a1, and

234
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:39,104
a2, and a3, and a4. So we're making four
random choices. And what I'm saying is,

235
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:44,893
let's condition on the outcomes of the
first three. Suppose we knew, that a1

236
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:52,422
turns up 173, a2 shows up 122 and a3 shows
up 723, but we don't know what a4 is. A4

237
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:56,908
is still equally likely to be any of zero,
one, two all the way up to n-1. So

238
00:17:56,908 --> 00:18:02,552
remember that what we want to prove is
that at most 1/n fraction of the choices

239
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:07,001
of a1, a2, a3, and a4, cause this
underlined equation to be true, cause a

240
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:12,003
collision. So what we're going to show is
that for each fixed choice of a1, a2, and

241
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:18,062
a3, at most a 1/n fraction of the choices
of a4 cause this equation to hold. And if

242
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:23,543
we can show that for every single choice
of a1, a2, and a3, no matter how those

243
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:28,378
random coin flips come out, almost a 1/n
fraction of the remaining outcomes satisfy

244
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:32,364
the equation, then we're done. That means
that at most of 1/n fraction of the

245
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:36,403
overall outcomes can cause the equation to
be true. So if you haven't seen the

246
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:39,718
principle of, for these decisions before,
you might want to think about this a

247
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,022
little bit offline, but it's easily
justified by just say two lines of

248
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:47,261
algebra. Okay, so we're done with the
setup and we're ready for the meat of the

249
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:51,934
argument. So we have done is, we've
identified an equation which is now in

250
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:57,637
green, which occurs if and only if we have
a collision between the two IP addresses.

251
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:02,938
And the question we need to ask is, for a
fixed choices of a1, a2 and a3, how

252
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:08,033
frequently will the choice of a4 cause
this equation to be satisfied? Cause a

253
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:12,973
collision? Now, here is why we did this
trick of the Principle of Deferred

254
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:19,196
Decisions. By fixing a1, a2, and a3, the
right hand side of this equation is now

255
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:25,619
just some fixed number b etween zero and
n-1. So maybe this is 773, right? The xi's

256
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:30,891
were fixed upfront, the yi's were fixed
upfront. We fixed a1, a2, a3 at the

257
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:35,613
beginning, at the end of the last slide,
and those were the only ones involved in

258
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:41,512
the right hand side. So this is 773 and
over on the left hand side, x4 is fixed,

259
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:48,239
y4 is fixed but a4 is still random. This
is an integer equally likely to be any

260
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:53,653
value between zero and n-1. Now here's the
key claim, which is that the left-hand

261
00:19:53,653 --> 00:20:00,028
side of this green equation is equally
likely to be any number between zero and

262
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:05,554
n-1. And I'll tell you the reasons why
this key claim is true. Although this is

263
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:08,525
the point where we need a little bit of
number theory, so I'll be kind of

264
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:12,061
hand-wavy about it. So there's three
things we have going for us, the first is

265
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:16,044
that x4 and y4 are different. Remember our
assumption at the beginning of the proof

266
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:19,373
was that, you know, the IP addresses
differ somewhere so why not just assume

267
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:23,115
that they differ in the last 8-bits of the
proof. Again this is not important if you

268
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:26,648
really wanted to be pedantic you could
have three other cases depending on the

269
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:30,418
other possible bits in which the IP
addresses might differ. But anyway, so,

270
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:36,409
because x4 and y4 are different, what that
means is that x4 - y4 is not zero. And in

271
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:41,662
fact, now that I write this, it's jogging
my memory of something that I should have

272
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:45,988
told you earlier, and forgot, which is
that the number of buckets n should be at

273
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:50,777
least as large as the maximum coeffcient
value. So for example, we definitely want

274
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:53,574
the number of buckets n in this equation
to be bigger than x4, and bigger than y4.

275
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:57,752
And the reason is, otherwise you could
have x4 and y4 being different from each

276
00:20:57,752 --> 00:21:03,597
other, but they still, the difference
still winds up being zero mod-n. So for

277
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:08,319
example, suppose n was four, and x4 was
six and y4 was ten. Then x4-10 would be

278
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,563
-four and that's actually zero modulo
four. So that's getting now what you want.

279
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,614
You want to make sure that if x4 and y4
are different, then they're difference is

280
00:21:15,614 --> 00:21:19,721
non-zero modulo n. And the way you ensure
that is that you just make sure n is

281
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:23,669
bigger than each. So you should choose a
number of buckets bigger than the maximum

282
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,577
value of the coefficient. So in our IP
address example, remember that the

283
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:31,802
coefficient don't get bigger than 255. And
I was suggesting a number of buckets equal

284
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:35,681
the same 997. Now, in general, this is
never a big deal in practice, if you only

285
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:39,752
wanted to use say, 100 buckets, you didn't
want to use 1000, you wanted 100, well,

286
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:42,660
then you could just use smaller
coefficients, right, you could just break

287
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,694
up the IP address, instead of into 8-bit
chunks, you could break it into 6-bit

288
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:49,721
chunks, or 4-bit chunks, and that would
keep the coefficient size smaller than the

289
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:54,004
number of buckets, okay? So you could
choose the buckets first, and then you

290
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:57,080
choose how many bits to chunk your data
into, and that's how you make sure this is

291
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,093
satisfied. So back to the three things we
have going for us in trying to prove this

292
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:06,025
key claim. So x4 and y4 are different, so
their difference is non-zero modulo n. So

293
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:10,243
second of all, n is prime, that was part
of the definition, part of the

294
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:15,458
construction. And then third, a4, this
final coefficient is equally likely to

295
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,908
take on any value between zero and n-1.
So, just as a plausibility argument, let

296
00:22:19,908 --> 00:22:24,053
me give you a proof by example. Again, I
don't want to detour into elementary

297
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:28,045
number theory, although it's beautiful
stuff, so you know, I encourage those of

298
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:32,052
you who are interested to go learn some
and figure out exactly how you prove it.

299
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:36,045
You really only need the barest elementary
number theory to give a formal proof of

300
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:39,739
this. But just to show you that is true in
some simple examples, so let's think about

301
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:44,486
a very small prime. Let's just say there's
seven buckets and let's suppose that the

302
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:48,667
difference between x4 and y4 is two. Okay,
so having chosen the parameters of set n =

303
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:52,984
seven, I've set the difference equal to
two. What I want to do is I want to step

304
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:57,319
through the seven possible choices of a4,
and look at what we get in this blue

305
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:01,910
circle quantity, on the left hand side of
the green equation. So, we want to say the

306
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,371
left hand's equally likely to be any of
the seven numbers between zero and six, so

307
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:10,454
that means that as we try our seven
different choices for a4, we better get

308
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:15,359
the seven different possible numbers as
output. So, for example, if we set a4 =

309
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,421
zero, then the blue circled quantity is
certainly itself zero. If we set it equal

310
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:24,602
to one, then it's one  two, so we hit
two. For two, we get two  two which is

311
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:30,529
four. For three, we get three  two which
is six. Now, when we set a4 = four, we get

312
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:30,731
four  two which is eight, modulo seven is
one. Five  two - seven is three. Six

313
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:31,438
two - seven is five. So as we cycle
through a4, zero through six, we get the

314
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:31,438
value zero, two, four, six, one, three,
five. So indeed we cycle through the seven

315
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:31,640
possible outcomes one by one. So if a4 is
chosen uniformly and random, then indeed

316
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:31,640
this blue circled quantity will also be
uniformly random. So just to give another

317
00:23:31,640 --> 00:00:00,000
quick example, we could also keep n =
seven, and think about the difference of

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
x4 and y4. Again, we have no idea what it
is, other than that its non-zero. So, you

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
know, maybe instead of three, maybe, maybe
instead of two, it's three. So now again,

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
let's stop through the seven choices of
a4, and see what we get. So now we're

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
going to get zero, then three, then six,
then two, then five, and then one, and

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
then four. So again, stepping through the
seven choices of a4, we get all of the

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
seven different possibilities of this left
hand side. And it's not an accident that

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
these choices are parameters. As long as n
is prime, x4 and y4 are different, and y

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ranges over all possibilities, so will the
value on the left-hand side. So by

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
choosing a four uniformly random, indeed,
the left-hand side is equally likely to be

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
any of its possible values, zero, one, two
up to n-1. And so, what does that mean?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, basically it means that we're done
with our proof cuz remember, the

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
right-hand side that circled in pink is
fixed. We fixed a1, a2, and the a3. The

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
x's and y's have been fixed all along so
this is just some number, like 773. And

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
so, we know that there's exactly one
choice of a4 that will cause the left-hand

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
side to also be equal to 773. Now a4 has n
different possible values and it's equally

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
likely to take one on becaus e only a
one-end chance that we're going to get the

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
unlucky choice of a4 that causes the
left-hand side to be equal to 773 and of

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
course, there's nothing special about 773.
Doesn't matter how the right-hand side

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
comes out. We have only one-hand chance of
being unlucky and having a collision and

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
that is exactly the condition we are
trying to prove and that establishes the

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
universality of this function each of n^4,
very simple, very easy to evaluate hash
