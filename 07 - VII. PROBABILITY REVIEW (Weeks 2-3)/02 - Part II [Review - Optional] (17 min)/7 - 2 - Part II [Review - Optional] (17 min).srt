1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,423
So welcome to part two of our probability
review. This video assumes you've already

2
00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:08,846
watched part one or at least are familiar
with concepts covered in part one. Namely

3
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:13,056
sample spaces, events, random variables,
expectation and linearity of expectation.

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:17,426
In this part of the review we're going to
be covering just two topics. Conditional

5
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:21,689
probability and the closer related topic
of independence. Both between events and

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,952
between random variables. I want to remind
you that this is by no means the only

7
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:30,376
source you can or should use to learn this
material. A couple of other sources free

8
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:34,716
that I recommend are lecture notes that
you can find online by Eric. And also

9
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:40,287
there's a wiki book on discrete
probability. So, conditional probability,

10
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:43,705
I hope you're not surprised to hear, is
fundamental to understanding randomized

11
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:47,252
algorithms. That said, in the five weeks
we have here, we'll probably only use it

12
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:50,453
once. And that's in analyzing the
correctness of the random contraction

13
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:54,086
algorithm for computing the minimum cut of
an undirected graph. So, just to make sure

14
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:57,633
we're all on the same page, here's some
stuff you should have learned, from part

15
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,835
one of the probability review. You should
know what a sample space is. This

16
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:04,165
represents all of the different outcomes
of the random coin flips, all of the

17
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:07,842
different things that could happen. Often
in randomized algorithm analysis, this is

18
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:11,086
just all of the possible random choices
that the algorithm might make. Each

19
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:14,669
outcome has some known probability
[inaudible]. By and, of course, the sum of

20
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:19,207
the probabilities equal one and remember
that event is nothing more than a subset

21
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:23,413
of omega. Omega is everything that could
possibly happen. S is some subset of

22
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:27,619
things that might happen and, of course,
the probability of event is just the

23
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,991
probability of, of all the outcomes that
the event contains. So, let's talk about

24
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:38,784
conditional probability. So one discusses
the conditional probability of one event

25
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:44,760
given a second event. So, let X and Y
denote two events, subsets of the same

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,547
sample space. You might want to think
about these two events X and Y in terms of

27
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:53,730
an event diagram. So we could draw a box,
representing everything that could

28
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,192
conceivably happen. So that's Omega. Then
we can draw a blob corresponding to the

29
00:01:58,192 --> 00:02:02,543
event X. So that's some stuff. Might or
might not happen, who knows. And then the

30
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:07,060
other event Y is some other stuff which
might or might not happen. And in general

31
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,411
these two events could be disjoint, that
is they could have no intersection. Or

32
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:15,637
they might have a non-trivial
intersection. X intersect Y. Similarly

33
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:21,880
they need not cover omega. It's possible
that nothing X nor Y happens. So what's

34
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,523
we're looking to define is the probability
of the event X given the even Y. So we

35
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:37,630
write probability of X bar Y, phrased X
given Y. And the definition is, I think,

36
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,987
pretty intuitive. So given Y means we
assume that something in Y happened.

37
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:46,701
Originally anything in omega could have
happened. We didn't know what. Now we're

38
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:51,476
being told that whatever happened that
lies somewhere in Y. So we zoom in on the

39
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:55,713
part of the picture that, in which
contains Y. So that's gonna be our

40
00:02:55,713 --> 00:03:01,339
denominator. So, our new world is the
stuff in Y. That's what we know happened.

41
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:07,629
And now we're interested in the proportion
of Y that is filled up with X. So, we're

42
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:13,996
interested in what fraction of Y's area is
occupied by stuff in X. So X intersect Y,

43
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:20,362
divided by the probability of Y. That is
by definition the conditional probability

44
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:25,311
of X given Y. Let?s turn to a quiz, using
our familiar example of rolling two dice.

45
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:29,714
To make sure that the definition of
conditional probability makes sense to

46
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:35,107
you. Okay, so the correct answer to this
quiz is the third answer. So let's see why

47
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:39,577
that is. So what are the two events that
we care about? We want to know the

48
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:44,487
probability of X given Y, where X is the
event that at least one die is a one. And

49
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:49,435
Y is the events that the sum of the two
dice is seven. Now, the easiest way to

50
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:54,640
explain this is let's zoom in, let's drill
down on the Y. Let's figure out exactly

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,780
which outcomes Y comprises. So the sum of
the two dice, being seven, we saw in the

52
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:06,013
first part of the review, there's exactly
six outcomes which give rise to the sum

53
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:15,200
seven, namely the ordered pairs one, six.
Two five, three four, four three, five

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:23,135
two, and six one. Now, remember that the
probability. Of x given y is by definition

55
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:28,688
the probability of x intersect y divided
by the probability of y. Now, what you

56
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:34,525
notice from this formula is we actually
don't care about the probability of x per

57
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:40,363
se or even about the event x per se, just
about x intersect y. So, let's just fig,

58
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:46,058
so, now we know why there has to be six
outcomes. Which of those also belong to x?

59
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:51,966
Well, x is those where at least one die is
one. So, x intersect y is just going to be

60
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:56,661
the one, six and the six, one. Now the
probability of each of the 36 possible

61
00:04:56,661 --> 00:05:01,375
outcomes is equally likely. So each one is
one over 36. So since X intersects Y, has

62
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,973
only two outcomes. That's gonna give us
two over 36 in the numerator. Since Y has

63
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:10,342
six outcomes, that gives us a six over 36
in the denominator. When you cancel

64
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:14,883
everything out, you're left with a one
third. So just applying the definition of

65
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:19,482
conditional probability to the correct
definition of the two relevant events, we

66
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:24,138
find that indeed a third of the time is
when you have a one condition on the sum

67
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:32,574
of the two being seven. Let's move on to
the independence of two events. So. Again

68
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:39,476
we consider two events, x and y. By
definition, the events are dependent if

69
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:46,850
and only if the following equation holds.
The probability that both of them happen.

70
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:53,523
That is the probability of x intersect y
is exactly equal to the probability that x

71
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:59,403
happens times the probability that y
happens. So that's a simple innocuous

72
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:05,839
looking definition. Let me re phrase it in
a way that it's even more intuitive. So

73
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,534
I'll you check this, it's just a some
trivial algebra. This equation holds, for

74
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:15,926
the events X and Y, if and only if, this
is just using the definition of

75
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:21,185
conditional probability we had on the last
slide, if and only if the probability of X

76
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:26,757
given Y, Is exactly the same thing as the
probability of x. So, intuitively, knowing

77
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:32,113
that y happens, gives you no information
about the probability that x happens.

78
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:37,399
That's the sense in which x and y are
independent. And, you should also check

79
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:42,337
that this holds if and only if, the
probability of y, given x, equals the

80
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:47,412
probability of y. So, symmetrically,
knowing that X has occurs gives you no

81
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:52,347
information, no new information about
whether or not Y has occurred. The

82
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:57,623
probability of Y is unaffected by
conditioning on X. So at this juncture I

83
00:06:57,623 --> 00:07:02,559
feel compelled to issue a warning. Which
is, you may feel like you have a good

84
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:06,828
grasp of independence. But, in all
likelihood, you do not. For example I

85
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:11,678
rarely feel confident that I have a keen
grasp on independence. Of course I use it

86
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:16,646
all the time in my own research and my own
work, but it's a very subtle concept. Your

87
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:21,615
intuition about independence is very often
wrong, even if you do this for a living. I

88
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:26,228
know of no other source that's created so
many bugs in proofs by professional

89
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:31,078
mathematicians and professional computer
science researchers as misunderstandings

90
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:35,538
of independence and using intuition
instead of the formal definition. So, for

91
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:40,082
those of you without much practice with
independence, here's my rule of thumb for

92
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:44,571
whether or not you treat random variables
as independent. If things are independent

93
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:48,682
by construction, like, for example, you
define it in your algorithm, so the two

94
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:53,118
different things are independent. Then you
can proceed with the analysis under the

95
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:57,499
assumption that they're independent. If
there's any doubt, if it's not obvious the

96
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:01,610
two things are independent, you might want
to, as a rule of thumb, assume that

97
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,988
they're dependent until further notice. So
the slide after next will give you a new

98
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:09,804
example showing you things which are
independent and things which are not

99
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:13,671
independent. But before I do that I wanna
talk about independence of random

100
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:18,054
variables rather than just independence of
events. So you'll recall a random variable

101
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:22,231
is from the first video on probability
review. It's just a real value function

102
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:26,408
from the sample space to the real numbers.
So once you know what happens you have

103
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:30,716
some number. The random variable evaluates
to some real number. Now, what does it

104
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:34,934
mean for two random variables to be
independent? It means the events of the

105
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:39,152
two variables taking on any given pair of
values are independent events. So

106
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:43,595
informally, knowing the value taken on by
one of the random variables tells you

107
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:48,095
nothing about what value is taken on by
the other random variable. Recalling the

108
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:52,707
definition of what it means for two events
to be independent, this just means that,

109
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:57,263
the probability that A takes on value
little a, B takes on value little b. The

110
00:08:57,263 --> 00:09:01,987
probability that both of those happen is
just the product of the probabilities that

111
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:06,304
each happens individually. So what's
useful about independence of events is

112
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:10,730
that probabilities just multiply. What's
useful about independence of random

113
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,215
variables is that expectations just
multiply. So, we're going to get an analog

114
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:20,108
of linear expectation where we can take,
we can interchange an expectation in the

115
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:24,768
product freely, but I want to emphasize
this, this interchange of the expectation

116
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:29,020
of the product is valid only for
independent random variables and not in

117
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,505
general, unlike linear expectations. And
we'll see a non example. We'll see how

118
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:37,805
this fails on the next slide for non
independent random variables. So, I'll

119
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:42,415
just state it for two random variables,
but the same thing holds by induction for

120
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,969
any number of random variables. If two
random variables are independent, then the

121
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:52,108
expectation of their product. Equals the
product of their expectations. And again,

122
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:56,677
do not forget that we need a hypothesis.
Remember, linearity of expectations did

123
00:09:56,677 --> 00:10:01,476
not have a hypothesis for this statement
about products. We do have a hypothesis of

124
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,928
them being independent. So why is this
true? Well, it's just a straight forward

125
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:10,554
derivation where you follow your nose or
write it out here for completeness, but,

126
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:14,428
but I really don't think it's that
important. So you start with the

127
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:19,459
expectation of the product. This is just
the average value of A times B, of course

128
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:24,470
weighted by the probability of, of any
particular value. So the way we're gonna

129
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,867
group that sum is we're going to sum over
all possible combinations of values, A and

130
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:35,136
B, that capital A and capital B might take
on, so that's gonna give us a value of A

131
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:40,009
times B. Times the probability of that big
A takes on the value of little a and

132
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:45,167
capital B takes on the value of little b.
So that's just by definition where this is

133
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:49,772
the value of the random variable, capital
A times capital B and this is the

134
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:55,974
probability that it takes on that value
with the values A and B. Now because A and

135
00:10:55,974 --> 00:11:00,334
B are independent, this probability
factors into the product of the two

136
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:05,000
probabilities. This would not be true if
they were not independent. It's true

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,084
because they're independent. So same sum
where all possible joint values of all A

138
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:15,289
and B. You still have A times B. But now
we have times the probability that A takes

139
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:20,431
on the value of A times the probability
that B takes on the value of B. So now we

140
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:25,636
just need to regroup these terms. So let's
first sum over A. Let's yank out all the

141
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:30,715
terms that depend on little a. Notice none
of those depend on little b. So we can

142
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:35,222
yank it out in front of the sum over
little b. So I have an A times the

143
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:40,227
probability that big A takes on the value
of little a. And then the stuff that we

144
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:45,134
haven't yanked out is the sum over b, of b
times, little b times the probability that

145
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,204
capital B takes on the value little b. And
what's here inside the quantity? This is

146
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:55,068
just the definition of the expectation of
b. And then what remains after we have

147
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:59,992
factored out the expectation of b? Just
this other sum which is the definition of

148
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:04,247
the expectation of a. So, indeed four
independents random variables, the

149
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:09,354
expected value of the product is equal to
the product of the expectations. Let's now

150
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:14,035
wrap up by tying these concepts together
in an example, a simple example that

151
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:18,838
nevertheless illustrates how it can be
tricky to figure out what's independent

152
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:23,127
and what's not. So here's the set up.
We're going to consider three random

153
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:31,390
variables. X1, X2 and X3. X1 and X2 we
choose randomly, so they're equally likely

154
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:36,746
to be zero or one. But X3 is completely
determined by X1 and X2. So it's gonna be

155
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:41,902
the XOR of X1 and X2. So XOR stands for
exclusive or. So what that means is that

156
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:47,057
if both of the operands are zero, or if
both of them are one, then the output is

157
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:52,017
zero. And if exactly one of them is one,
exactly one of them is zero, then the

158
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:57,369
output is one. So it's like the logical or
function, except that both of the inputs

159
00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:02,594
are true, then you output false, okay? So
that's exclusive or. Now this is a little

160
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:07,570
hand wavy, when we start talking about
probabilities, if we want to be honest

161
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,808
about it, we should be explicit about the
sample space. So what I mean by this, is

162
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:18,112
that X1 and X2 take on all values, they're
equally likely. So we could have a zero,

163
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:23,611
zero or a one zero or a zero one or a one,
one and in each of these four cases, X3 is

164
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:28,849
determined by the first two, as the X or,
so you get a zero here, a one here, a one

165
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:33,876
here and a zero there. And each of these
four outcomes is equally likely. So let me

166
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:38,418
now give you an example of two random
variables, which are independent, and a

167
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,960
non example. I'll give you two random
variables which are not independent. So

168
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,682
first, I claim that, if you think that X1
and X3, then they're independent random

169
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:53,400
variables. I'll leave this for you to
check [sound]. This may or may not seem

170
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,184
counter-intuitive to you. Remember X3 is
derived in part from X1. Never the less,

171
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:04,468
X1 and X3, are indeed independent. And why
is that true? Well, if you innumerate over

172
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:09,488
the four possible outcomes, you'll notice
that all four possible two byte strings

173
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:14,388
occur as values for one and three. So here
they're both zero, here they're both one,

174
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:19,169
here you have a zero and one, and here you
have a one and zero. So you've got all

175
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:23,949
four of the combinations of probability
one over four. So it's just as if X1 and

176
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:28,610
X3 were independent fair coin flips. So
that's basically why the claim is true.

177
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,831
Now. That's a perhaps counterintuitive
example of independent random variables.

178
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:37,190
Let me give you a perhaps counterintuitive
example of dependent random variables.

179
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,117
Needless to say, this example just
scratches the surface and you can find

180
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:45,099
much more devious examples of both
independent and non-independents if you

181
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:50,121
look in, say, any good book on discrete
probability. So now let?s consider the

182
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:57,138
random variable X1 product X3. And X two
and the claim is these are not

183
00:14:57,138 --> 00:15:02,577
independent. So this'll give you a formal
proof for. The way I'm going to prove this

184
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:06,963
could be slightly sneaky. I'm not going to
go back to the definition. I'm not gonna

185
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:10,868
contradict the consequence of the
definition. So it's proved that they're

186
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:15,201
not independent all I need to do, is show
that the product of the expectations is

187
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,999
not the same as the expectations to the
products. Remember if they were

188
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:22,636
independent, then we would have that
equality. [inaudible] Product of

189
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:27,129
expectations will equal the expectation to
products. So if that's false than there's

190
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,021
no way these random variables are
independent. So the expectation of the

191
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:35,591
product of these two random variables is
just the expected value of the product of

192
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:41,573
all three. And then on the other side, we
look at The product of the expected value

193
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:47,824
of X1 and X3. And the expected value of
X2. So let's start with the expected value

194
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:53,500
of X2. That's pretty easy to see. That is
zero half the time and that is one half

195
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,821
the time. So the expected value of X2 is
going to be one-half. How about the

196
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:04,285
expected value of X1 and X3? Well, from
the first claim, we know that X1 and X3

197
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:09,322
are independent random variables.
Therefore, the expected value of their

198
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:14,417
product is just the product of their
expectations. Equal this expectations

199
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:19,445
equal to the expected value of X1 times
the expected value of X2, excuse me, of

200
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:24,603
X3. And again, X1 is equally likely to be
zero or one. So its expected value is a

201
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:29,760
half. X3 is equally likely to be zero or
one so its expected value is a half. So

202
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,789
the product of their expectations is
one-fourth. So the right-hand side here is

203
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:40,011
one-eighth; one-half times one-fourth, so
that's an eighth. What about the left-hand

204
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:44,781
side, the expected value of X1 times X3
times X2? Well, let's go back to the

205
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:49,977
sample space. What is the value of the
product in the first outcome? Zero. What

206
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:55,424
is the value of the product in the second
outcome? Zero. Third outcome? Zero. Forth

207
00:16:55,424 --> 00:17:01,000
outcome? Zero. The product of all three
random variables is always zero with

208
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,674
probability one. Therefore, the expected
value, of course, is gonna be zero. So

209
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:12,726
indeed, the expected value of the product
of X1, X3 and X2 zero does not equal to

210
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:18,097
the product of the corresponding
expectations. So this shows that X1, X3

211
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:20,140
and X2 are not independent.
